# Pi with OpenAI Codex

Run [Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) in a Docker Sandbox using Codex
access from a ChatGPT subscription. Authentication uses OpenAI OAuth, not an
OpenAI API key or API billing.

## Requirements

- Docker Sandboxes with `sbx` and schema v2 OAuth credential-file support
- A ChatGPT subscription with Codex access

## Run

```console
sbx kit validate .
sbx run --kit . pi-openai-codex
```

On the first launch:

1. Approve the `openai-codex` credential binding when prompted.
2. Run `/login openai-codex` in Pi.
3. Select **Device code login (headless)** and sign in.

Use `/model` to select another Codex model. Pi stores its state under
`~/.pi/agent/`; refreshed OAuth credentials can be restored when the sandbox is
recreated.

## Security

Pi needs the real OAuth access-token JWT to determine the ChatGPT account ID, so
the kit enables OAuth passthrough. Access and refresh tokens are therefore
available inside the sandbox at `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` with mode `0600`. Keep
the sandbox private and do not copy or share this file.

Network access is restricted in `spec.yaml`. Pi's update check and telemetry are
disabled, and the kit does not modify user settings.

## Development

Node.js 20 or newer is required. Run:

```console
./scripts/check
```

This installs locked test dependencies, audits them, runs the tests, and invokes
`sbx kit validate .` when `sbx` is available. Otherwise, validation must be run
on the Docker Sandbox host.

To upgrade Pi, change `PI_AGENT_VERSION` in `spec.yaml`, then test a fresh
sandbox and recreation of an existing one.

## Sign out

Run `/logout` in Pi to remove its local credential. Remove the corresponding
`openai-codex` credential binding with the `sbx` commands supported by your
Docker Sandboxes version if you also want to remove the host-side credential.
